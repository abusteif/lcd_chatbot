Signing up for an LawConnect Lawyer account is the first step to listing your law firm on LawConnect. 
 
Each law firm has a single LawConnect lawyer account to which it can 
invite
 as many lawyers and legal professionals as are necessary. 
 
In this article, we explain the nature of LawConnect Lawyer accounts and provide instructions on how to sign up for LawConnect on behalf of your firm.
 
How LawConnect Lawyer accounts work 
LawConnect Lawyer accounts are designed to accommodate law firms of all sizes—from sole practitioners to huge firms with 100s of lawyers. 
 
On LawConnect, each law firm has a single account and the sign-up process typically includes the following flows:
 
1.  The practice manager signs up for a LawConnect Lawyer account (instructions below).
 
2.  The practice manager 
invites
 the lawyers and other members of the firm to join the LawConnect Lawyer account.  
 
3.  Individual lawyers 
accept their invitation and sign up
 for their own account, which is linked to, and managed through, the main LawConnect Lawyer account. 
 
All individual legal professionals have a dedicated area in 
LawConnect 
—
My Dashboard
—in which they can manage their 
lawyer profile
 and 
appointments
. Each professional signs in to LawConnect with their own credentials (email address and password), which they set during their 
sign-up process
. 
 
Lawyers who are NOT also practice managers, only need to follow the instructions for step 3 in 
Accepting an invitation to sign up for LawConnect as a lawyer
. Sole practitioners, who are typically both managers and lawyers, will usually need to only follow the instructions below in this article, and can ignore steps 2 and 3 above.

sign up for a linked LawConnect account
. Their LawConnect accounts are managed within the main firm account. 
 
In this article, we provide instructions on how to invite individual lawyers and other legal professionals in your firm to LawConnect as a practice manager. 
 
Each lawyer has a dedicated area in LawConnect —
My Dashboard
—in which they can manage their 
lawyer profile
 and  
appointments
. Each professional signs in to LawConnect with their own credentials (email address and password), which they set during their 
sign-up process
. 
 
For an overview of how LawConnect Lawyer accounts work and instructions on how to sign up for one, see 
Signing up for a LawConnect Lawyer account as a practice manager

LawConnect
.
 
You can invite new professionals at any time using the above steps.
 
 
Managing pending invites

The configuration options for the various appointment types are set at the defaults.

Assigning an appointment form
The  
APPOINTMENT FORM
 section allows you to assign a form to an appointment type.

Appointment forms are used to solicit the necessary information from clients. During the 
booking process
, clients enter and submit their details in a form. 
 
LawConnect provides one pre-configured form—
Default
 form—that allows the client to enter their name, surname, mobile number, email address and a summary of their legal issue. This form is suitable for, and used by, all the default appointment types. 
 
See

This is a handy feature that you can use for a number of purposes. For example, you could redirect clients to a page that details the documentation they need to provide for a specific process. You can redirect to any web page, whether on your firm website or on a third-party site. 
The 
For Existing Clients Only?
 and 
Offer Free First Appointment?
 feature options are highlighted in each lawyer's profile, when enabled.  
These options are contradictory and this screenshot was created for demonstration purposes only.
 
The

Managing your law firm's LawConnect account
Managing your firm's LawConnect Lawyer account as a practice managerForms facilitate client bookings on LawConnect. When a 
client books an appointment
, they furnish their information by entering their details in a form that they then submit.  
 
All 
appointment types
 need to be assigned a form to function correctly. LawConnect provides a default form that allows entry of basic information and is suitable for most appointment types. 
 
In this article we explain how forms work in LawConnect, and provide instructions on how to create new forms and manage current forms in LawConnect as a practice manager. 
 
 
 
Understanding Default form
LawConnect provides one form—named 
Default form
—that is suitable for most basic appointment types. It allows the client to enter their first and last name, mobile number, email address and a summary of their legal issue. 
 
Default form
 is assigned to all default appointment types. See 
Adding and managing appointment types for your law firm as a practice manager
 for more.
 
 
 
How LawConnect forms work
Forms are typically made up of one or more form fields and a submission button. Form behavior, and what happens to the information after submission, can be complex. LawConnect takes care of this complexity, while still allowing you to create complex forms.  
 
The basic fields required to create a LawConnect account—first and last name, email address and mobile number—are included in all forms automatically. These fields either display or are hidden, depending on whether the user is signed in or signed out of LawConnect. 
 
These screenshots compare 
Default form
 when a user is signed out (left) and signed in (right). 
 
To configure a custom form, it is only necessary to edit or replace the last text (legal summary) field, and add additional fields. LawConnect takes care of the rest automatically. See 
Adding forms

Status
: The appointment status. 
Appointments are marked

appointment type
.

About appointment bookings
Individual lawyers and law firms set different requirements for their booking process. 
 
There are general requirements that apply to all bookings. Many law firms also require:
Authentication of you mobile number, and/or
Confirmation of the appointment by the individual lawyer before the booking is finalized. 
General requirements and these common, additional requirements are taken into account in the instructions in the following section. 
 
Further requirements are also possible, but these are less common. For example:
The appointment type may only be available to existing clients, in which case you are required to confirm that you are already a client of the lawyer.
You could be redirected to a page on the lawyer's website during the booking process to answer a questionnaire or read the prerequisites for your particular issue.  
These requirements are not taken into account in the instructions in the following section.

.LawConnect can be configured to send appointment-reminder notifications to clients by either, or both, email and SMS. 
 
In this article we provide an explanation of how, why and when appointment reminders are sent, as well as instructions on how to disable them, if you prefer. 
 
 
 
About appointment reminders
Each lawyer or law firm optionally enables (or disables) either, or both, email and SMS appoint reminders for each appointment type. This means that whether you receive notifications, and the type you receive (email and/or SMS), is not directly within your control. 
 
Most calendar applications also offer appointment reminders that you can enable (and disable) in the application settings. These notifications, together with LawConnect notifications, can result in you receiving reminders from more than one source about the same appointment. 
 
You can easily disable LawConnect notifications. See the 
Disabling appointment reminders
 section
 
below for instructions. 
 
 
 
When will you receive notifications?
If enabled, LawConnect sends both email and SMS reminders at the same time. They are sent:
24 hours before your appointment, if the appointment was booked more than 24 hours before the scheduled time, or 
1 hour before your appointment, if the appointment was booked less than 24 hours before the scheduled time. 
For example, if you book an appointment for 2 hours from now, you will receive notifications in 1 hour, and if you book for 2 days from now, you will receive them 1 day (24 hours) from now.
 
 
 
Disabling reminder notifications
You need to disable appointment reminders on an appointment-for-appointment basis, that is, for each appointment you book. Disabling for a phone call appointment type, does NOT automatically disable reminders for a consultation with the same lawyer, or a phone call with a different lawyer, for example.   
 
You can disable notifications via email or SMS. Either method disables BOTH notification types. 
 
Warning! Once disabled, reminder notifications cannot be re-enabled.
 
 
To disable appointment-reminders notifications via email::
 
1.  Open the confirmation email you received after booking the appointment.
2.  Select 
Stop Appointment Reminders

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.lawtap.com/widget.js"></script>
<!-- LawTap Lawyer Widget end -->
 
The code for the law firm widget is very similar and the same principles and instructions (below) apply.
 
Here is the default widget in a post in WordPress.
 
If you are comfortable doing so, you can tweak the code in the code editor to ensure that it renders and displays as you would like it to. 
 
We recommend that you only change the size and theme and leave the rest of the code as is.
 
To change basic parameters: 
data-width="800px": Change 
800
 to a smaller or larger pixel size. 
 
data-height="600px": Change 
600
 to a smaller or larger pixel size. 
 
This parameter is sometimes disregarded. 
data-theme="darkblue": You can change 
darkblue
 to 
grey
, 
lightblue
, 
green
 and 
black
. 
Note! Parameter values cannot contain spaces.
If these options are not sufficient, you can fully customize the colour scheme:
Set a custom primary colour using the 
hex value
 of the colour. 
For example, data-theme="AA0114" (dark red). 
You can also set a secondary colour and different font as follow using the data-theme-settings sub-parameters
For example, 
data-theme="ff0000" data-theme-settings="secondary_color:#ff00ff | font:open-sans".
 
Here is the lawyer booking widget in the 
lightblue
 data-theme, resized to a width of 400 pixels.

Known limitations and workarounds of the Time Matters integration (Beta)
LawConnect cannot synchronize (read or write) contacts between LawConnect and Time Matters. 
Workaround
: No workaround is available at this time.
LawConnect does not know the timezone for each event made available in the Time Matters API. 
Workaround
: LawConnect assumes the timezone used is the same as that set for the lawyer in their LawConnect account in 
Account > Account Settings > Timezone
.  
LawConnect only checks for availability changes in Time Matters every two (2) hours and only for 500 events in advance. This means that double bookings are possible if the 
APPOINTMENT INFORMATION >
 
No Earlier Than
 field for the 
appointment type
 in LawConnect is set to less than 2 hours AND the lawyer updates Time Matters with a conflicting event in the upcoming 2 hours. 
Workaround
: If this scenario is likely, set the 
No Earlier Than
 field to 2 hours or more, to mitigate the risk of double booking. Zoom is the market leader for online video meetings. It is used daily by 200+ million participants.

.Stripe is a leading payment processor used by millions of businesses in more than 40 
countries
 around the world. LawConnect is a 
Stripe Verified Partner
.
 
The LawConnect Stripe connector allows law firms to receive secure credit card payments for client appointments that comply with regulations relating to legal trust accounting.
 
In this article, we take you through the process of connecting and using Stripe on LawConnect. 
 
 
Requirements
LawConnect subscription; and
Stripe account.
If you do not have a Stripe account, you can one during the connection process. 
 
 
How the LawConnect integration with Stripe works
Payments for appointments are completely automated and require no manual intervention. This is the typical payment flow: 
Client books appointment
: LawConnect sets a time-limited 
pre-authorisation
 for the amount of the appointment fee on the client's credit or debit card.
This pre-authorisation remains active until the scheduled end time of the appointment or until the appointment is cancelled. Pre-authorisation is also known as a "preauth" or "authorisation hold". 
Client attends appointment
: At the appointment end time, LawConnect automatically authorises the appointment fee from the client's card and transfers it to the bank account linked to your law firm's Stripe account, after deducting any LawTap appointment processing fee and Stripe card processing fee.
The authorisation process is also known as "capture" or "settlement".
If an appointment is cancelled before the scheduled appointment start time, the pre-authorisation is automatically cancelled and the fee becomes available to the client as soon as it is processed by their bank.
 
Compliance with legal trust accounting regulations
LawConnect's integration with Stripe was designed and developed to comply with the majority of legal trust accounting best practices and client accounting laws/regulations. It is compliant because:
Payment card pre-authorisations do not fall within the definition of "trust money", as defined by relevant laws/regulations; and
The appointment payment is only processed at the appointment end time (that is, after the lawyer has delivered the legal service to the client).
If the lawyer or client cancels the appointment before the appointment time, a full "refund" (also know as a "reversal of the pre-authorisation") is processed automatically .
