Your LawConnect account is typically created during the booking process when you 
book your first appointment
 with a lawyer. However, if you prefer, or if your circumstances require, you can create a LawConnect account separately, that is, without booking an appointment.  
 
In this article, we provide instructions on how to create a LawConnect following a process that does not include booking an appointment with a lawyer. 
 
You can 
search for a lawyer
 and 
book your first appointment on LawConnect
 WITHOUT separately creating a LawTap account.
