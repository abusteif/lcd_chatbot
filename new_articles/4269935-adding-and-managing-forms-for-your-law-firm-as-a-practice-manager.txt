Forms facilitate client bookings on LawConnect. When a 
client books an appointment
, they furnish their information by entering their details in a form that they then submit.  
 
All 
appointment types
 need to be assigned a form to function correctly. LawConnect provides a default form that allows entry of basic information and is suitable for most appointment types. 
 
In this article we explain how forms work in LawConnect, and provide instructions on how to create new forms and manage current forms in LawConnect as a practice manager. 
 
 
 
Understanding Default form
LawConnect provides one form—named 
Default form
—that is suitable for most basic appointment types. It allows the client to enter their first and last name, mobile number, email address and a summary of their legal issue. 
 
Default form
 is assigned to all default appointment types. See 
Adding and managing appointment types for your law firm as a practice manager
 for more.
 
 
 
How LawConnect forms work
Forms are typically made up of one or more form fields and a submission button. Form behavior, and what happens to the information after submission, can be complex. LawConnect takes care of this complexity, while still allowing you to create complex forms.  
 
The basic fields required to create a LawConnect account—first and last name, email address and mobile number—are included in all forms automatically. These fields either display or are hidden, depending on whether the user is signed in or signed out of LawConnect. 
 
These screenshots compare 
Default form
 when a user is signed out (left) and signed in (right). 
 
To configure a custom form, it is only necessary to edit or replace the last text (legal summary) field, and add additional fields. LawConnect takes care of the rest automatically. See 
Adding forms
 below for more.
