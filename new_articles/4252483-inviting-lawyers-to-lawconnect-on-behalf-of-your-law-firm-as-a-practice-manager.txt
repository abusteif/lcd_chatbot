Each law firm has a single LawConnect Lawyer account to manage the firm activity as a whole on LawConnect. You can invite as many lawyers and other legal professionals as necessary to 
sign up for a linked LawConnect account
. Their LawConnect accounts are managed within the main firm account. 
 
In this article, we provide instructions on how to invite individual lawyers and other legal professionals in your firm to LawConnect as a practice manager. 
 
Each lawyer has a dedicated area in LawConnect —
My Dashboard
—in which they can manage their 
lawyer profile
 and  
appointments
. Each professional signs in to LawConnect with their own credentials (email address and password), which they set during their 
sign-up process
.

How to invite lawyers to LawConnect 
To invite lawyers to your firm's LawConnect Lawyer account:
 
1.  Select the 
Account
 link in the top bar to access your 
Account
 area.
In this context, "your account" means the 
account you created on behalf of your law firm
.
 
2.  In 
Pending Members
 select 
Invite Members
.
 
3.  Create invitation emails for all lawyers and legal professionals simultaneously:
Enter the first lawyer's email address, name and surname.
Select 
Add Member
 to display an additional form.
Repeat these steps until you have added all the members of your firm. 
4.  Select 
Send Invites
.
 
LawConnect automatically sends invitation emails to your invitees. The emails are personalized and sent from a LawConnect email address (
support@lawconnect.com
) on your behalf with the subject line: 
<Your Name> invited you to join <Your Law Firm Name> on 
LawConnect
.
 
You can invite new professionals at any time using the above steps.
 
 
Managing pending invites
The invited lawyers are listed in the 
Pending Members
 area and their status is marked 
Pending
 until they activate their accounts.
 
You can use the actions in the 
Actions
 column to:
Re-send
 the invitation email.
Cancel
 the invitation. 
This action does not send another email. When the invitee attempts to accept the invitation, the link results in a 404 (page not found) error.  
 
 
Viewing legal professionals in your firm
When the lawyers and other professionals 
accept their invitations and sign up
 to LawConnect, they are moved into the 
Active Members
 area and their status changes to 
Fully Active
. 
 
This is a full list of all members of your firm on LawConnect. The links in the 
Name
 column open each 
lawyer's profile
 on LawConnect.
