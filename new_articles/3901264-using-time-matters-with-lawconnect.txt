Known limitations and workarounds of the Time Matters integration (Beta)
LawConnect cannot synchronize (read or write) contacts between LawConnect and Time Matters. 
Workaround
: No workaround is available at this time.
LawConnect does not know the timezone for each event made available in the Time Matters API. 
Workaround
: LawConnect assumes the timezone used is the same as that set for the lawyer in their LawConnect account in 
Account > Account Settings > Timezone
.  
LawConnect only checks for availability changes in Time Matters every two (2) hours and only for 500 events in advance. This means that double bookings are possible if the 
APPOINTMENT INFORMATION >
 
No Earlier Than
 field for the 
appointment type
 in LawConnect is set to less than 2 hours AND the lawyer updates Time Matters with a conflicting event in the upcoming 2 hours. 
Workaround
: If this scenario is likely, set the 
No Earlier Than
 field to 2 hours or more, to mitigate the risk of double booking.
