My Appointments
 is your dedicated area in LawConnect to manage all your appointments with lawyers. 
 
There are individual actions for each appointment that allow you to view, cancel, reschedule, review appointments and more. 
 
In this article we provide instructions on how to manage your appointments and demonstrate how to use each action. 
 
 
 
Accessing My Appointments
Your 
My Appointments
 area opens when you 
sign in to LawConnect
. You can access it at any time by selecting 
My Appointments
 in the top bar. 
 
My Appointments
 displays a summary of your appointments with lawyers on LawConnect in a table. The ID, status, date and time, appointment type and lawyer's name are included for each appointment, as well as actions that allow you to perform available tasks.
The actions available for each appointment vary, depending on the appointment type and date (and time) of the appointment. Future appointments all have a 
Cancel
 action, and many, but not all, past appointments have a 
Review
 action. The features for each appointment type are set by individual lawyers and firms. 
 
Each appointment confirmation email, as well as all email and SMS notifications, contain links to execute the same actions that are available in 
My Appointments
.
