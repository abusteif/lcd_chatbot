Signing up for an LawConnect Lawyer account is the first step to listing your law firm on LawConnect. 
 
Each law firm has a single LawConnect lawyer account to which it can 
invite
 as many lawyers and legal professionals as are necessary. 
 
In this article, we explain the nature of LawConnect Lawyer accounts and provide instructions on how to sign up for LawConnect on behalf of your firm.
 
How LawConnect Lawyer accounts work 
LawConnect Lawyer accounts are designed to accommodate law firms of all sizes—from sole practitioners to huge firms with 100s of lawyers. 
 
On LawConnect, each law firm has a single account and the sign-up process typically includes the following flows:
 
1.  The practice manager signs up for a LawConnect Lawyer account (instructions below).
 
2.  The practice manager 
invites
 the lawyers and other members of the firm to join the LawConnect Lawyer account.  
 
3.  Individual lawyers 
accept their invitation and sign up
 for their own account, which is linked to, and managed through, the main LawConnect Lawyer account. 
 
All individual legal professionals have a dedicated area in 
LawConnect 
—
My Dashboard
—in which they can manage their 
lawyer profile
 and 
appointments
. Each professional signs in to LawConnect with their own credentials (email address and password), which they set during their 
sign-up process
. 
 
Lawyers who are NOT also practice managers, only need to follow the instructions for step 3 in 
Accepting an invitation to sign up for LawConnect as a lawyer
. Sole practitioners, who are typically both managers and lawyers, will usually need to only follow the instructions below in this article, and can ignore steps 2 and 3 above.
