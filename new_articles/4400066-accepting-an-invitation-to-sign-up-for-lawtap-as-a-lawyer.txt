Each lawyer or other legal professional in a law firm has their own LawConnect account. These individual accounts are managed within a single 
LawConnect Lawyer account registered to the law firm
. Typically, the practice manager creates the main account and then invites each lawyer to sign up for LawConnect.  
 
In this article, we provide instructions on how to accept a LawConnect invitation and sign up for a LawConnect account as a lawyer.
 
All individual legal professionals have a dedicated area in LawConnect —
My Dashboard
—in which they can manage their 
lawyer profile
 and 
appointments
. Each professional signs in to LawTap with their own credentials (email address and password), which they set during the sign-up process (instructions below).
 
For an overview of LawConnect Lawyer accounts and instructions on how to create one on behalf of your law firm see
