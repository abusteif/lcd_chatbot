LawConnect accumulates all appointments for each lawyer and displays them in their 
My Dashboard
 area. Appointments are updated in real time and you can see a comprehensive, up-to-date overview of your client appointments at any time. 
 
Appointments in 
My Dashboard
 can originate from three sources:
Appointments booked directly by your clients
.
Appointments booked by you for your clients
.
Appointments booked for your clients by your practice manager
.  
In this article, we take you through the process of managing your client appointments on LawConnect as a lawyer. The instructions include how to access, filter, search, sort, view, reschedule, cancel, delete, confirm and download appointments, as well as how to reply to client feedback about an appointment.
 
Practice managers can execute all the actions mentioned in this article on behalf of the lawyers in their firm in the 
Firm Dashboard
 area. See 
Managing client appointments for the lawyers in your firm as a practice manager
 for more.
