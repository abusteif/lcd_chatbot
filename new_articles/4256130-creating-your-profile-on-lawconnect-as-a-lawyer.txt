Your individual lawyer profile is your opportunity to showcase your legal expertise, qualifications and services on LawConnect. It is an important tool to attract new clients.
 
Lawyer profiles display individually on their own page, which is typically opened when clients select the lawyer's name in a teaser box in your 
firm profile
 or on a 
search results
 page.
 
In this article, we take you through the process of creating all sections of you lawyer profile and demonstrate how and where each element displays on LawConnect.
