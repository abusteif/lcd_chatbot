About the existing-email error
If you attempt to book an appointment or create an account using an email address that is already registered in LawConnect , the system prevents you from proceeding. You receive an "
Email is linked to an existing LawConnect account

The existing account may have been created by you (perhaps during a previous booking that you cannot recall) or by a lawyer on your behalf.
