Customising your booking widget
This is example code for a widget for a single lawyer's profile. 
 
<!-- LawTap Lawyer Booking Widget start. See the LawTap Help Portal for further information: https://help.lawtap.com/en/articles/1763373 -->
<div class="lawtap-widget" data-country="UK" data-mode="lawyer" data-key="rachael-smith" data-width="800px" data-height="600px" data-theme="darkblue"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.lawtap.com/widget.js"></script>
<!-- LawTap Lawyer Widget end -->
 
The code for the law firm widget is very similar and the same principles and instructions (below) apply.
 
Here is the default widget in a post in WordPress.
 
If you are comfortable doing so, you can tweak the code in the code editor to ensure that it renders and displays as you would like it to. 
 
We recommend that you only change the size and theme and leave the rest of the code as is.
 
To change basic parameters: 
data-width="800px": Change 
800
 to a smaller or larger pixel size. 
 
data-height="600px": Change 
600
 to a smaller or larger pixel size. 
 
This parameter is sometimes disregarded. 
data-theme="darkblue": You can change 
darkblue
 to 
grey
, 
lightblue
, 
green
 and 
black
. 
Note! Parameter values cannot contain spaces.
If these options are not sufficient, you can fully customize the colour scheme:
Set a custom primary colour using the 
hex value
 of the colour. 
For example, data-theme="AA0114" (dark red). 
You can also set a secondary colour and different font as follow using the data-theme-settings sub-parameters
For example, 
data-theme="ff0000" data-theme-settings="secondary_color:#ff00ff | font:open-sans".
 
Here is the lawyer booking widget in the 
lightblue
 data-theme, resized to a width of 400 pixels.
