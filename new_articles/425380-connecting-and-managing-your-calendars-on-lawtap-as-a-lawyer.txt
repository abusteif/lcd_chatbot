An online calendar allows you to effectively manage your availability. You can avoid double bookings, maximise your real-time availability and deliver a great client experience.
 
LawConnectsupports Microsoft Exchange/Outlook/Hotmail, Microsoft 365, Google Calendar/G Suite and Apple iCloud calendars, by default.
 
Connecting your calendar is typically the last step of the process when 
signing up for a LawConnect Lawyer account
 or when 
accepting an invitation to LawConnect as a lawyer
.
 
In this article, we take you through the process of connecting to one or more calendar applications after sign-up, and provide instructions on how to manage calendar connections. 
 
Note! If you have not connected your calendar, LawConnect still allows you to book appointments for your assigned 
appointment types
, but this may result in double bookings and a poor client experience, as it is not possible to establish your availability in real time.
