Contacts are synced automatically in both LawConnect and Rocket Matter and there is no need to take any manual action in this regard. Specifically:
New LawConnect appointment contacts are created as a Rocket Matter contact (if the contact does not already exist in Rocket Matter).

Known Limitations
Rocket Matter does not support the E.164 international phone numbering plan format. This means that all phone numbers are assumed to be North American  (USA and Canada) numbers.
Rocket Matter does not support ISO 3166 for international country names. This means if LawConnect cannot automatically match a contact's country, the U.S.A. is used as the default.
Rocket Matter Task Due Dates may automatically be set as the previous day to the appointment for some time zones.
