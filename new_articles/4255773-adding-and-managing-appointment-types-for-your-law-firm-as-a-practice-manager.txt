Appointment types are the kinds of appointments offered to clients by lawyers on LawConnect. The default types include phone calls and meetings at lawyer's offices and at court.   
 
Appointment types clarify the appointment booking process for clients, who can see at a glance which appointment types are offered by each lawyer and law firm. The available types display in the 
Select Appointment Type
 pick list in the booking widget that displays in your firm profile and in each lawyer's profile. 
 
Appointment types are set on a a firm-wide basis, typically by the practice manager, who assigns each type to individual lawyers. 
 
You can use the default appointment types or create your custom types to suit your firm's precise requirements.
 
In this article we cover how to access, manage, configure, assign and create new appointment types on behalf of your firm as a practice manager.
